Hello!

This package is the complete project for a SNES Gargoyles prototype.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyles_(video_game)

"The game was released exclusively for the Sega Genesis on May 15, 1995.[1] A Super NES version planned for a Christmas 1995 release was cancelled."

I am releasing this package to the community for educational purposes only.  You are free to play with it and do with it as you will, but you are NOT allowed to make money out of it or profit in any way, shape or form.  I know you won't.  I trust you.

This is an early test prototype for the SNES version of Gargoyles, which was never released. This project is by Pete Fokos, who I worked with early on at Disney Software. The project was taken over by Joe Sengir who took the game a lot further before the project was ultimately cancelled. The prototype shows a titlepage with music, with selectable test levels. The test levels are rudimentary. The package is complete and contains some executable tools, source code and a runnable ROM image. If you ever meet me and buy me a beer, I'll tell you some stories. I hope you enjoy messing with this code as much as I did creating it.

Cheers!
