## [hashtag](#ide) IDE

There are no dedicated IDEs for 65c816 assembly. You can use any ASCII editor, such as Notepad or VS Code. However, some people made various plugins for existing code editors to add extra features, such as syntax highlighting:

- Josh Neta's "[65816 Assemblyarrow-up-right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshneta.65816-assembly)" plugin for VS Code
- Vice's "[65816 SNES Assembly Language Serverarrow-up-right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vicerust.snes-asm)" plugin for VS Code
- lx5's "[Asar syntax highlightarrow-up-right](https://github.com/TheLX5/AsarSyntaxHighlight-VSCode)" plugin for VS Code.
- Telinc1's "[65c818 ASM syntax for highlight.jsarrow-up-right](https://github.com/telinc1/smwcentral-highlightjs-asar)" as a JavaScript plugin

Assembly files are generally saved with the file extension ".asm".
