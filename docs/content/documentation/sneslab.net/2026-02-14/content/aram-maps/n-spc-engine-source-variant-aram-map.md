NOTE: This ARAM map only goes up to $800, which is the start of the SPC700 program. This is intended to show the purpose of the RAM-like memory locations that are used, which are stored prior to the start of this program.

NOTE 2: This is not a representative ARAM map for all N-SPC variants. However, a lot of these memory locations may be recycled, depending on the variant.

ARAM Address Description `$00-$03` CPUIO register input. Technically only `$00` is used in the code, but the structure is set up for all four CPUIO registers to be read from. `$04-$07` CPUIO register output. Technically only `$04` is used in the code, but the structure is set up for all four CPUIO registers to be read from. `$08-$0B` Last value read by the CPUIO register. Technically only `$08` is used in the code, but the structure is set up for all four CPUIO registers to be read from. `$0C` Tick counter for the song to initialize itself. `$0D` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `sf3c`. `sf0c` is `$0C`'s internal variable name in the source code. Thus, it's probably an initialization tick counter for something else. `$0E-$0F` Always zero. Read for an operation where YA needs to have its bits inverted. `$10-$13` Scratch RAM with varying purposes. `$14-$17` Scratch RAM mostly used for storing word addresses, though sometimes this isn't the case. `$18-$19` Contains an RNG value. Generated every timer 0 tick. `$1A` SFX voice on flag (AKA which music channels should not play notes) `$1B` Fast Forward flag. `$1C-$1F` Unused. `$20` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skc`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$21` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skdw`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$22` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skd`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$23` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skdadw`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$24` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skdad`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$25` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skca`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$26` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skcb`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$27` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `skcs`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chs`/`soko-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$28-$2B` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `bkc`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chc`/`bakuhatu-on` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$2C-$2D` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `adk`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chd`/`sound effect` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. The variable itself is internally marked as `kokaon add.`. *TODO guess purpose* `$2E` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `sac`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chd`/`sound effect` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$2F` Unused. However, its internal variable name in the source code is `sacs`, and it appears to have been intended for a `chd`/`sound effect` routine, where the code to call it is commented out in the source. *TODO guess purpose* `$30-$3F` Track pointer for the music, one word per track. `$40-$41` Phrase pointer. `$42` Phrase jump counter. `$43` Fractional counter for the CPUIO/SFX tempo ticker (running at a tempo of `$20`). `$44` Current channel being processed times 2. `$45` Key on flag for all channels.
