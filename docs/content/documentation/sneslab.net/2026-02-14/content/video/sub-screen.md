The **Sub Screen** is a virtual render target used in Color Math. It is not a framebuffer, but a circuit.

Some game instruction booklets (for example FF3, *Chrono Trigger*, and *A Link to the Past*) call the pause screen the "Sub Screen" but actually display it on the color math main screen. The *Legend of Zelda* for the NES called the screen where the player chooses which item to equip the "subscreen," so perhaps Nintendo decided to overload that term when designing the SNES PPU.
