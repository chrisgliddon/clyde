**Mode 5** is one of the hi-res background modes, meaning the horizontal resolution is 512 dots. When interlacing is enabled, the vertical resolution is also doubled. \[4] Many JRPGs use Mode 5.\[3] The higher resolution helps Japanese text be more legible.

It is the second least frequently used background mode. \[2] PVSnesLib currently does not support Mode 5. \[1] Color Math should not be used in Mode 5.\[5]\[7]

Background tiles may be 8 by 8 pixels or 16 by 16 pixels in Mode 5.

*RPM Racing* uses Mode 5 for gameplay.\[6]
