BG Layers Available Layer 2 Layer 1 4bpp 8bpp

**Mode 3** is a background mode that supports many colors, often seen in title screens.\[2] In this mode, BG1 supports Direct Color, but BG2 does not.\[1] The horizontal resolution is 256 dots. Mode 3 has the highest number of bits per pixel (12) out of all the background modes with max layers enabled.

Background tiles may be 8 by 8 pixels or 16 by 16 pixels in Mode 3.\[1]

*NBA All-Star Challenge* uses Mode 3 for gameplay.

Offset Change Mode is unsupported even though Layer 3 is unavailable, perhaps because that would take up too much PPU time.

Mosaic, interlacing, and windowing are supported.
