A **scanline** is a single row of dots, produced by a single horizontal sweep of the raster beam across the TV screen from left to right. A scanline takes 1364 master cycles.\[1]

It takes the raster beam approximately 63.5 microseconds to draw a scanline and then hblank.\[3]

Scanlines can be 4 cycles longer or shorter than normal.
