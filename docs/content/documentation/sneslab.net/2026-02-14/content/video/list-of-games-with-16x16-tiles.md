Most SNES games seem to use 8x8 tiles, but here are some that use 16x16:

*Alisha's Adventure* *Dottie Dreads Nought* *Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3D* *Magical Pop'n* *Melfand Stories* *Nekotako* *Super Bomberman* *Tom and Jerry* *Yoshi's Island*

16x16 tile mode can be enabled on a per-background basis via bits 4-7 of BGMODE (2105h).
