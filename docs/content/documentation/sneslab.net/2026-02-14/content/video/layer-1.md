**Layer 1** is one of the Super NES's five hardware layers. In *Super Mario World* 1 levels, it is used to store all objects, like ground, walls, different blocks and pipes in a level. However, in some levels, Layer 2 is used for another layer of objects. Layer 1 stores all the objects in every single level. *Yoshi's Island* 1 pictured. Layer 1 on the overworld

In overworld maps, Layer 1 contains all levels and paths (not the visible ones). It's icon is a ghost house in Lunar Magic Overworld Editor. The layer 1 in Overworld is stored as 16x16 grid, unlike Layer 2, which is 8x8.
