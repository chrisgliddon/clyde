A **Backdrop Color** is one that appears behind all other layers. The SNES has two backdrop colors: one for the Main Screen and one for the Sub Screen.

The main screen's backdrop color is known as **color 0** and is the very first entry of CGRAM.

The sub screen's backdrop color is known as the **fixed color** and is set via the 8-bit COLDATA port (2132h).\[1]\[2]
