A **Screenblock Entry** (SE) is scene slang for a tilemap entry. The term appears to have originated circa 2004 in the TONC Game Boy Advance tutorial, motivated by the confusion caused by using the word "tile" for both the data contained in a tileset (a bitmap of pixels) and the data contained in a tilemap. An SE unambiguously refers to the latter.

The most important piece of information in a screenblock entry is the tile index.
