**Reduction** is Nintendo's (arguably poor) terminology for "shrink" (referring to shrinking things on the screen, i.e. modes 5, 6 and 7) and appears in the official Super Nintendo development manual.\[1]

This note also appears in fullsnes:

```
REPEATED EVERY 2-LINES. IF "1" IS WRITTEN, THE OBJ SEEMS REDUCED
          HALF VERTICALLY IN APPEARANCE.
```
