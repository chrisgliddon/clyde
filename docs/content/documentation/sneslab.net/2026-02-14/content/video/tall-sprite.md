A **Tall Sprite** is taller than it is wide. The SNES supports two sizes of tall sprites: 16x32 and 32x64.

When bits 5-7 of OBSEL are 110, both sizes of tall sprites can be used. When those same bits are 111, only 16x32 tall sprites and square 32x32 sprites can be used.

This is not documented in the official manual.
