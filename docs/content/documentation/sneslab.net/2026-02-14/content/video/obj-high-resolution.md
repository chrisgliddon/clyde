**OBJ High-Resolution** is a PPU feature which doubles the vertical resolution of [sprites](/mw/index.php?title=sprites&action=edit&redlink=1 "sprites (page does not exist)"). This is accomplished by squeezing the sprite so it is only half as tall. It is available only in interlaced mode.

It is enabled or disabled via bit 1 of SETINI (2133h).
