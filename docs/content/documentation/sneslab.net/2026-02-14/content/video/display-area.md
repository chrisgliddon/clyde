The **Display Area** refers to the visible part of the screen. Most of the time in games that scroll, a background extends beyond the display area. The PPU does not allow you to write to its registers during the display period (unless you enable fblank). When the vertical blanking period begins, the display period ends.

The horizontal resolution is usually 256 dots, but is 512 dots in modes 5 & 6.
