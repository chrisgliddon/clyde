This table shows how Nintendo recommends beginners initialize the SNES registers. All values are hexadecimal.

Some registers appear 8 bits wide to the 5A22 but actually hold 16 bits of data - these are known as "write-twice." Nintendo notates the recommended initial values of write-twice registers with the low byte on the left, and the high byte on the right (the same order the CPU should write to them) but which is opposite of most other 16-bit values.
