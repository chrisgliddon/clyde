**Program Counter Relative Addressing** is supported by nine instructions on the 65c816:

- BCC (opcode 90)
- BCS (opcode B0)
- BEQ (opcode F0)
- BMI (opcode 30)
- BNE (opcode D0)
- BPL (opcode 10)
- BRA (opcode 80)
- BVC (opcode 50)
- BVS (opcode 70)

All of which are two bytes long.

The **effective address** is generated by sign-extending the 8-bit operand to 16 bits and then adding it to the program counter. The program bank register remains the same.

#### Syntax

```
BRA nearlabel
```

Where nearlabel is in the range of -128 to 127 bytes away from the next opcode after BRA.
