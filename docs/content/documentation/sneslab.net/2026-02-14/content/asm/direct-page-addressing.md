**Direct Page Addressing** is an addressing mode that is supported by the 65c816 and SPC700. It is an upgraded version of zero page addressing. The effective addresses generated by it are always in bank 0.\[4]

The operand specifies which byte of the direct page to access.

#### Syntax

```
LDA dp
```

Supported by 24 instructions on the '816:

- ADC (opcode 65)
- SBC (opcode E5)
- EOR (opcode 45)
- ASL (opcode 06)
- LSR (opcode 46)
- INC (opcode E6)
- DEC (opcode C6)
- BIT (opcode 24)
- CMP (opcode C5)
- CPX (opcode E4)
- CPY (opcode C4)
- ORA (opcode 05)
- AND (opcode 25)
- LDA (opcode A5)
- LDX (opcode A6)
- LDY (opcode A4)
- ROL (opcode 26)
- ROR (opcode 66)
- STA (opcode 85)
- STX (opcode 86)
- STY (opcode 84)
- STZ (opcode 64)
- TRB (opcode 14)
- TSB (opcode 04)
