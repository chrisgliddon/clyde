**Stack Relative Indirect Indexed, Y Addressing** is supported by eight instructions:

- ADC (opcode 73)
- AND (opcode 33)
- CMP (opcode D3)
- EOR (opcode 53)
- LDA (opcode B3)
- ORA (opcode 13)
- SBC (opcode F3)
- STA (opcode 93)

They are all two bytes long.

The **indirect address** lives on the stack at sum of the stack pointer and the 8-bit operand.

The **effective address** is generated by concatenating the data bank register to the indirect address, and then adding the Y index register to the 24-bit sum.

#### Syntax

```
LDA (sr, S), Y
```
