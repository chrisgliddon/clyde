**Stack Relative Addressing** is supported by eight instructions:

- ADC (opcode 63)
- AND (opcode 23)
- CMP (opcode C3)
- EOR (opcode 43)
- LDA (opcode A3)
- ORA (opcode 03)
- SBC (opcode E3)
- STA (opcode 83)

They are all two bytes long. The effective addresses generated by stack relative addressing will always be in bank 0.\[3] The effective address is the sum of the stack pointer and the 8-bit operand byte.

#### Syntax

```
LDA sr, S
```

There is no long version of this addressing mode.
