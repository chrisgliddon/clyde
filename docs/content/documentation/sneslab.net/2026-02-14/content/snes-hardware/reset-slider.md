The **Reset Slider** on the Super Nintendo is the purple plastic slider to the right of the Eject Button. It is connected in series with VCC and pin 8 of the F411 CIC chip.

The Super Famicom has a reset pushbutton instead of a slider.

Unlike the Power Switch, the reset button will open automatically when let go of.

WRAM is unaffected through a reset. \[1]
