- [S-DSP](https://www.romhacking.net/documents/191)

### Errata

- In **regs.txt** under "BG Modes" we have "The SNES has 7 background modes," it should say 8.
- In the S-DSP doc, we have "Certain games do seem to depend on these exact formulas, trying to **simplify** will break some sound effects." But "approximate" would probably be clearer than "simplify," as in mathematics simplifying a formula only reduces the number of symbols used to express it, which may be easier to read but otherwise leaves it equivalent.
