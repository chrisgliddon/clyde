The SNES has several of what appear to be pull-down resistors:

Resistors **Name** **Notes** R4 connected to XIN R23 R24 R26 (1.8k), connected to S-ENC R57 connected to the output of op-amp B and the base of Q16 R64 connected to the output of op-amp A and the base of Q17 R93 connected to EXT Audio-R R94 connected to EXT Audio-L R95 connected to Cart Audio-R R96 connected to Cart Audio-L R106 connected to APU Audio-R R107 connected to APU Audio-L
