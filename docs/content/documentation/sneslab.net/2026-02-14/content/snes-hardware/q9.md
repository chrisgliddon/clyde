**Q9** is an NPN bipolar junction transistor that appears to amplify the /CSYNC line. The base is connected to R22, which is in series with both pin 100 of S-PPU2 and pin 8 of the Video Encoder. The emitter is connected to R25, which is in series with pin 3 of the Multi-Out. The collector is supplied by VCC.
