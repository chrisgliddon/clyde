The SNES has several **decoupling capacitors** connected to (mostly) VCC and ground. On the jwdonal schematic, some of the are:

Name Connectivity Capacitance C85 in parallel with the F411 CIC 0.1 microfarad C90 in parallel with the S-CPU 0.1 microfarad C91 in parallel with S-PPU1 0.1 microfarad C92 in parallel with S-PPU2 0.1 microfarad C93 in parallel with the upper VRAM chip 0.1 microfarad C94 in parallel with the lower VRAM chip 0.1 microfarad C95 in parallel with S-WRAM 0.1 microfarad C87 in parallel with S-SMP 0.1 microfarad C98 and C99 in parallel with S-DSP 0.1 microfarad C100 in parallel with the lower ARAM chip 0.1 microfarad C101 in parallel with the upper ARAM chip 0.1 microfarad C84 in parallel with the Video Encoder 1 microfarad

This 0.1 microfarad decoupling cap is connected to VS:

- C80, in parallel with the Pre-Amplifier op-amp for the right stereo channel
