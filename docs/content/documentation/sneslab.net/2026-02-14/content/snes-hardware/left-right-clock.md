The **Left Right Clock** controls stereo processing. The rising and falling edges tell when processing for one stereo channel begins and the other stops. It is denoted **LRCK**, and connected to pin 13 of the 16-bit Stereo DAC and pin 43 of the Sony S-DSP sound chip.

In 2023 it was observed that this clock starts out slow and slowly speeds up as it gets warmer. \[2]
