**SlowROM** is 2.68 Mhz and its ROM access speed is 200ns. It is not as fast as FastROM. SlowROM is a property of the ROM chip itself and not the board it is soldered onto.\[2] DMA always happens at SlowROM speed. When the 5A22 is operating at slowROM speed, there are 8 master clock cycles per CPU machine cycle.
