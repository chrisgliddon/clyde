The **Arithmetic and Logic Unit** (ALU) is an essential part of many CPUs, including the 65c816. The ALU is a full 16 bits wide on the '816 - it calculates the results of data operations (such as ADC and SBC) and effective addresses for relative and indexed addressing modes.

The following flags may be updated after an ALU operation:

- Carry Flag
- Negative Flag
- Overflow Flag
- Zero Flag
