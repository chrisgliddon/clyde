The **Pixel Clock** signal is generated by the PPU by dividing the Master Clock frequency by 4. On NTSC, the pixel clock is 5.37 MHz. On PAL, 5.32 MHz. \[1]

According to the ares source code, the PPU usually emits one dot every 4 CPU clock cycles (typo for master cycles?), but some long dots take more cycles. \[2]
