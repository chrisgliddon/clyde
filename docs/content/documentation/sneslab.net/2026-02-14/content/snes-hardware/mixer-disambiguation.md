There are at least four audio mixers on the SNES:

- the Digital Mixer, which is part of the S-DSP and before the DAC
- the Echo Mixer, which writes to the Echo Ring Buffer
- The FIR Mixer, which consists of six clipped sums and one clamped sum
- the Analog Mixer, which is part of or next to the Post-Amplifier and after the DAC
