The SNES has several of what appear to be [pull-up resistors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pull-up-resistors/all):

Resistors **Name** **Notes** R7 connected to the internal emitter/base of the red Darlington pair R9 connected in series with R8 to the external emitter of the red Darlington pair R77, R78, R79, R80, R81, and R82 near the diode arrays R92 on the /IRQ line going into the S-CPU R97 on the EXPAND line going into the Cartridge Slot R47 on the /MUTE line, near Q13 R49 on the MUTE line, connected to Q13's collector R17 connected to the internal emitter/base of the blue Darlington pair R19 connected in series with R18 to the external emitter of the blue Darlington pair R12 connected to the internal emitter/base of the green Darlington pair R14 connected in series with R13 to the external emitter of the green Darlington pair R21 connected in series with C8 to the video encoder (blue line) R16 connected in series with C7 to the video encoder (green line) R11 connected in series with C6 to the video encoder (red line)
