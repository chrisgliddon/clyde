# Clyde
Named after a certain character in Final Fantasy VI, this project is an experiment to see if we can build something fun for the SNES with 65816 Assembly langauge.

## Questions
1. Do we know enough to write a full RPG game in 65816 Assembly?
2. Can we write performant, modular code?
3. How do we avoid halllucinations?
